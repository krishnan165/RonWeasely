      <p>My favorite character is Ron weasley.The weasleys are important beacuse of Ron(who is Harry's best friend) and for Arthur Weasley
the only dad character in the Harry Potter series.I like Ron because this is the only practical character in the Harry Potter series(other characters like Harry,Dombledore,hermione are not like a normal people) I like him because of his sence of humor and he also plays a main role Harry Potter.</p>

     <p>I liked him the most when he breaks his wand and his wand either porforms half the magic, like it does when he tries to transform a rat into a goblet and it turns into a goblet with fur and a alive tail, or backfires ,like it does when he tries a trick that will make people vomit slugs on Malfoy and he starts to vomit slugs!</p>
